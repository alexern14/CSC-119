# Suppose you put your younger brother in charge of backing up your
# work. Write a set of detailed instructions for carrying out this task.
# Explain how often he should do it, and what files he needs to copy
# from which folder to which location. Explain how he should verify that
# the backup was carried out correctly.

At 10am, noon, and 5pm, save all files that are presently open
    Check each tab in compiler and click File>Save
    If file asks for location use the default location prompted by the development environment

Create a backup of all files by copying the projects from the "CScience 119" and uploading them to the cloud at 5pm
    After saving files, verify that backup files were successfully saved by validating with WD Backup Anywhere program
    If WD Backup Anywhere doesn't inform you that the backup was completed successfully save and backup all files again
