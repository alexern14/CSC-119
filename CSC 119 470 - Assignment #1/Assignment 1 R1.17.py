# In How To 1.1, you made assumptions about the price of gas and
# annual usage to compare cars. Ideally, you would like to know
# which car is the better deal without making these assumptions.
# Why can't a computer program solve that problem?

A computer cannot solve this problem because a computer cannot predict the
future price of gas
