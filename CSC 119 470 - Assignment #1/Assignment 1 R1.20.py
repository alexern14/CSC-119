# Imagine the you and a number of friends fo to a luxury restaurant, and
# when you ask for the bill you want to split the amount and the tip (15%)
# between all. Write pseudocode for calculating the amount of money that
# everyone has to pay. Your program should print the amount of the bill,
# the total cost, and the amount each person has to pay. It should also
# print how much of what each person pays is for the bill and for the tip.

Get the bill

	Calculate total cost by adding the total bill and total tip together
Ask how many people are splitting the bill
	Generate each person's tab by dividing the (bill total + bill tip) / number of people
	Calculate each person's share of the bill by dividing the bill total by the number of people
	Calculate each person's share of the tip by dividing the bill tip by the number of people
Print the amount of the bill
Print the total cost
Print the amount each person has to pay
Print the amount of the bill each person has to pay
