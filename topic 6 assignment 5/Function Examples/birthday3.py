### The parentheses tell Python to execute the named function rather than just refer to the
### function. Python goes back and looks up the definition, and only then, executes the code
### inside the function definition. The term for this action is a "function call" or "function
### invocation.
### In the function call there is no def, but there is the function name followed by parentheses
###
###       function_name()

### In many cases you will use a feature of program execution in idle: that after program
### execution is completed, the Idle Shell still remembers functions defined in the program.
### this is not true if you run a program by selecting it directly in the operating system.

### In this example program, I've added two more lines that are not indented. Let's run the
### program!
### Because the two "happyBirthdayEmily lines are not indented, the interpreter executes the lines
### in sequence.
