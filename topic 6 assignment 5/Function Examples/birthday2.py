### Save this file, and assoicate the name with the whole song
### using a function definition. We use the Python def keyword, short for define
###
def happyBirthdayEmily(): ### This program does nothing as written
            print ("Happy Birthday to you!")
            print ("Happy Birthday to you!")
            print ("Happy Birthday , dear Emily.")
            print ("Happy Birthday to you!")

### LIne 1 - The heading contains def, the name of the funtion, parentheses, an finally a colon.
### A more general syntax is:
###
### def function_name ();
###
### Lines 2-5 - The remaining lines form the function body and are indented by a consistent amount.
### The exacet amount is not important -- though 2 to 4 spaces are common conventions. I've
### indented the code above with a tab.
### The whole definition does just that: defines the meaning of the name "happyBirthdayEmily",
### but it does not do anything else -- the def statement does not print anything.
