# Combine the following 4 functions into one program with a main driver:
# 1. Write a function that takes 5 int arguments and returns the largest of the 5.
#
# 2. Write a Python program to perform the task of temperature conversion from
# Celsius to Fahrenheit. Note that given C as the degree of temperature in Celsius,
# the corresponding degree F in Fahrenheit equals 1.8*C + 32.0. For example 50
# degree Celsius should be 122 degree Fahrenheit.
#
# 3. Continually prompt the user for an integer. Constrain the userâ€™s input to
# integers between 1 and 50,000. You can assume that the user will enter an integer
# and not a string or floating point number. Make sure you have a way of exiting the function.
#
# 4. Write a function that calculates that computes the balance of a bank account
# with a given initial balance and interest rate, after a given number of years.
# Assume interest is compounded yearly.
